/***
 * Challenge 2: Divide and conquer
 * First, create a function that returns the number of times an integer can be divided by
 * another integer without a remainder. The function should return null if the division
 * doesn‚Äôt produce a whole number. Name the function divideIfWhole.
 * Then, write code that tries to extract the nullable result of the function. There should
 * be two cases: upon success, print "Yep, it divides $answer times", and upon
 * failure, print "Not divisible :[".
 *
 * Finally, test your function:
 * 1. Divide 10 by 2. This should print "Yep, it divides 5 times"
 * 2. Divide 10 by 3. This should print "Not divisible :["
 *
 * Hint 1: Use the following as the start of the function signature:
 *      fun divideIfWhole(value: Int, divisor: Int)
 * You‚Äôll need to add the return type, which will be a nullable!
 *
 * Hint 2: You can use the modulo operator (%) to determine if a value is divisible by
 * another; recall that this operation returns the remainder from the division of two
 * numbers. For example, 10 % 2 = 0 means that 10 is divisible by 2 with no
 * remainder, whereas 10 % 3 = 1 means that 10 is divisible by 3 with a remainder of 1.
