/***
 * 6. Given a number as a Double value, determine if this number is a power of 2.
 *
 * Hint: You can use log2(number) to find the base 2 logarithm of number.
 * log2(number) will return a whole number if number is a power of two. Add
 * import kotlin.math.log2 to the top of your file to use log2.
 * You can also solve the problem using a loop and no logarithm.
