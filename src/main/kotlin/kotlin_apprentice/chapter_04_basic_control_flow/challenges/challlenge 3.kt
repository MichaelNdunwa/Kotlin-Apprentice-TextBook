 * 3. Suppose the squares on a chessboard are numbered left to right, top to bottom, with 0 being the top-left square
 *      and 63 being the bottom-right square. Rows are numbered top to bottom, 0 to 7. Columns are numbered left to
 *      right, 0 to 7. Given a current position on the chessboard, expressed as a row and column number, calculate the
 *      next position on the chessboard, again expressed as a row and column number. The ordering is determined by the
 *      numbering from 0 to 63. The position after 63 is again 0.
