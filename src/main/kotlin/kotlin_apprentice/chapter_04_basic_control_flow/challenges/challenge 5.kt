 * 5. Given a month (represented with a string in all lowercase) and the current year
 * (represented with an Int), calculate the number of days in the month. Remember
 * that because of leap years, “february” has 29 days when the year is a multiple of 4
 * but not a multiple of 100. February also has 29 days when the year is a multiple
